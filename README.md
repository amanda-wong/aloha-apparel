# Aloha Apparel

### Summary

[Aloha Apparel](http://amanda-wong.github.io/aloha-apparel/) is a fully responsive home page that scrolls to various sections of the page with a single click of the navigation item. In Featured Products, users are able add items to cart and instantly see their cart count in the shopping cart.

### Tools and methods

The building of Aloha Apparel focuses largely on HTML and CSS to create beautiful responsive website. Additionally, jQuery was also used to execute the cart count and bxslider feature.

Other tools and methods used include:
* Flexbox layout
* Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync, Uglify
* Git and GitHub

### Experience

Transitioning from using floats to flexbox has been a positive experience. I feel I have more options in how I control my children elements. I am also very fortunate to have gulp task runners helping me catch errors and minify my code. They are awesome time savers!
